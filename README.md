### Challenges Completer

### ðŸŸ¢ Easy  

- Created a **public repo** in the `codingUnited` org:  
  `challenge-cassandraAdair`

- Added a folder:  
  `challenge1-GithubRepoCreation`

- Created an `index.html` that displays:  
  `"Ready to Code!"`
  
- Committed and pushed to GitHub

---

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium  

- Cloned the repo locally using `git clone`
- Maked changes using a local code editor (text editor)
- Used a separate `feature` branch for your changes
- Opened a pull request to merge into `main`

---

### ðŸ”´ Hard  

- Added basic CSS to style your `index.html` (external)
- Used GitHub Issues to track your progress
- Included a `README.md` explaining your project and setup steps

---

### ðŸŸ£ Leet  

- âœ… Still working on...
- [ ] Enable **GitHub Pages** to publish the HTML file
- [ ] Add a `.gitignore` file and explain its purpose
- [ ] Set up a simple GitHub Action that runs on push  
  _(even just a linter or echo)_
- Added a favicon and use a custom font
